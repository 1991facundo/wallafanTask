Hi Facundo, very nice talking to you earlier today.

Here is what I'd like you to do:
Check our pricing table at the bottom of https://wallafan.com

I would like you to replicate it locally on your machine as a single page using html, css and js.
It should be responsive following the schema attached to this email, where on mobile the plans get stacked vertically so they all fit in one view while still expandable vertically as well, with non expanded ones stacking on top.

So, to recap, recreate our pricing table as it is and with same expanding functionality on a single draft page, just replace current responsiveness with the new vertical stack model.
